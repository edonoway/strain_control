`strain_control` is a package for controlling a Razorbill CSX1x0 strain cell with the Razorbill RP100 power supply (PS) and a Keysight E4980 LCR meter. The package is composed of two main submodules, the `strain_server`, which coordinates between the PS and LCR meter to control for strain, and the `strain_client`, which allows for control of the `strain_server` from a Jupyter notebook or other scripting environment independent of the `strain_server`. This design has been chosen to decouple the day-to-day use of the instrument from software that makes it run continuously and reliably, and log performance, over the course of a multi-day experiment.


# Setup

First, this package must be cloned from GitHub, as well as my particular fork of `PyMeasure`, since I have modified a few files. On the command line, run the following

```
git clone git@github.com:alexliebmanp/strain_control.git
git clone git@github.com:alexliebmanp/pymeasure.git
```

In addition, the following packages must be installed with `pip` if they aren't on your system already:

```
simple-pid
pyvisa
numpy
matplotlib
```

Lastly, `strain_control` and `PyMeasure` must be added to PYTHONPATH  or to the site-packages folder.

# Usage

To initiate the strain control server, edit the configurations as desired (described below), especially the initial sample length `L0_SAMP`, which is needed to get a correct measure of the strain, and simply run `strain_server.py`. On the command line,

```
python strain_server.py
```

This will popup a `matplotlib` display. The server starts in a stable initial state with voltage 1 and voltage 2 both set to 0, the strain setpoint set to 0, and no closed-loop control enabled.

To apply a voltage on the PS, enable closed-loop control, change the strain setpoint, modify the PS slew rate, or read off the current value for strain, etc., the user may import `strain_client.py` into any python environment. For example,

```
'''
An example notebook to demonstrate usage within a Jupyter Notebook.
'''

from strain_control.strain_client import StrainClient

sc = StrainClient()
sc.set_pid(1000,100,0.1)
sc.start_strain_control('PID')
sc.set_setpoint(0.05)
sc.get_voltage(1)
sc.get_strain()
sc.set_slew_rate(10)
sc.stop_strain_control()
sc.set_voltage(1,0)
sc.shutdown_server()
```

The first line after the import generates a `StrainClient` object, whose methods transmit messages to the `strain_server` and receive a response. See below for a description of the client methods.

NOTE: in the current version of this package, the socket communication host and port are hard-coded as `localhost` and `8888` respectively. In principle, the server can live on a remote computer and communication can be carried over a network.

# Strain Server

Most laboratory instruments come equipped with a dedicated control unit. For example, a Lakeshore temperature controller coordinates an applied *voltage* (to a heater) and a measured *resistance* (from a thermometer) to control for *temperature*, a third variable. The control unit runs it's own software to handle changes in temperature and maintain a set temperature. A user will often interact with the control unit (which also acts as a server) via a communications python package (client) to query the controller, change it's state, and read off measured values from buffers.

A Razorbill strain cell operates on much the same principle, except that it does not ship with a control unit that controls for *strain*. Instead, it comes with a power supply and a suggestion for purchasing an LCR meter. The power supply can output a *voltage* across two different channels to each piezo stack in the strain cell, and hence expand or contract the gap between the sample plates. The LCR meter can read a *capacitance* from a sensor. Based on a calibration curve and an initial sample length `L0_SMAP`, the capacitance can be related to the strain as follows:

```math
\sqrt(3)
```

In principle, the voltage can be changed to induce a change in strain, as measured with the capacitor.

Clearly, there is a need to coordinate these two instruments and control for *strain*. This is the job of the `strain_server`. The server runs over a few different threads:

1. main thread - initializes instruments and starts display
2. monitor thread - continuously queries PS and LCR meter to get values for voltage and capacitance, and converts the capacitance to a strain
3. control thread - when activated, initiates closed-loop control for strain in one of three modes, (1) PID, (2) Set Voltage, and (3) Combined
4. communications thread - listens for connections from the client and reacts appropriately to incoming messages

The server also includes features for properly and safely applying a voltage to the piezos. In particular, the `MAX_VOLTAGE` and `MIN_VOLTAGE` variables are used to limit the output voltage of the PS to user specified values (as described in the Razorbill manuals).

Here is a brief description of the three control modes:

1. PID: while in this mode, the server continuously updates the voltage output of the PS to achieve a desired `setpoint` utilizing a PID algorithm.
2. Set Voltage: in this mode, the server linearly ramps the voltage until the `setpoint` is achieved within some tolerance. It then maintains this voltage until the strain falls outside of the tolerance, at which point the loop repeats.
3. Combined: in this mode, the strain is roughly achieved using the Set Voltage algorithm, and then maintained with a PID loop.

(Eventually move these to a configuration file) The server may be configured in the source code by modifying the `strain_server.py` header,

```
SIM=True                    #  True to simulate PS and LCR meter for testing
STARTING_SETPOINT=0         # Initial setpoint
SLEW_RATE=0.5               # Initial slew rate
P=1000                      # Starting PID params
I=100
D=0.1
L0 = 68.68 # initial capacitor spacing    # gap between sensor plates at 0 strain
L0_SAMP = 68.68                           # sample length at 0 strain

### LIMIT OUTPUT VOLTAGE HERE ###

MAX_VOLTAGE = 119 # V                     # limits to output voltage
MIN_VOLTAGE = -19 # V

### COMMUNICATION SETTINGS ###
LCR_ADDRESS = None                        # communications addresses.
PS_ADDRESS = None
HOST = 'localhost'
PORT = 8888
```

Note: it is important that the server be shutdown properly using `shutdown_server()` command as described below. Otherwise, the strain cell system may be left in an unknown or unstable state, potentially leading to a dangerous situation.

# Strain Client
